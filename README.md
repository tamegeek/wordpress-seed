WordPress Docker Seed for Shared Development

# Start-up
This seeder allows for the creation of a WordPress development environment quickly that can also be shared with teams, as the database is exported. 

To get started with this seeder, you will need to run `composer install` to get all of the dependancies and the base build plugins. 
After this, run `docker-compose up -d`. There will be a blank starter database already installed to allow you to start development.
